# 🧩 Components

## 📥 1. Data Ingestion

Collects data from different sources like:

📄 PDF Files

🌐 Websites

📝 TXT Files

📊 CSV Files

🗃️ Databases

🔗 APIs

🎯 **Purpose:** Convert everything into plain text for processing.

---

## ✂️ 2. Text Chunking

Large documents are divided into smaller chunks to improve retrieval.

### 🌟 Benefits

✅ Better search accuracy

⚡ Faster retrieval

💰 Lower token usage

🧠 Better understanding by the LLM

---

## 🧠 3. Embedding Generation

Each chunk is converted into a numerical vector using an embedding model.

### 🔥 Popular Models

🤖 text-embedding-3-small

🤖 text-embedding-3-large

🤗 Sentence Transformers

🧠 BGE Embeddings

📌 Similar text ➜ Similar vectors ➜ Better search results!

---

## 🗄️ 4. Vector Storage (FAISS)

All embeddings are stored inside a **Vector Database**.

### 🚀 Popular Vector Databases

📦 FAISS

🌲 Pinecone

🟢 ChromaDB

⚡ Milvus

🌍 Weaviate

🎯 Purpose: Perform lightning-fast semantic similarity searches.

---

## 🔍 5. Retrieval

When the user asks a question:

➡️ Convert the query into an embedding

➡️ Compare it with stored vectors

➡️ Retrieve the **Top-K** most relevant chunks

🎯 Result: Only the most useful information is passed to the LLM.

---

## 📝 6. Prompt Construction

The retrieved chunks are combined with the user's original question.

📖 Retrieved Context

➕

❓ User Question

⬇️

🧠 Enhanced Prompt

This gives the LLM the background knowledge needed to answer accurately.

---

## 🤖 7. LLM Response Generation

The final prompt is sent to a Large Language Model such as:

💚 GPT

💙 Gemini

🦙 Llama

🟣 Claude

🟠 Mistral

The model analyzes:

📄 Retrieved Context

➕

❓ User Query

⬇️

💬 Generates an intelligent, context-aware response.
